### Known bugs
**Online players won't load in new level (50% fixed, needs help with this bug..)**\
When a player enters a new level/map the [Phaser Scene](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scene.html) reloads and a new tilemap will be loaded.
But the current players in that map will not be loaded in that level ([see Code](https://github.com/aaron5670/PokeMMO-Online-Realtime-Multiplayer-Game/blob/master/client/src/Scene2.js#L107)).
